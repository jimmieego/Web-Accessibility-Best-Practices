# Web Accessibility for GIS Professionals

## Introduction

This webinar introduces the basics of web accessibility, its benefits to GIS professionals, examples of accessible web apps using ArcGIS technology, and web accessibility testing process. We will provide an overview of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the international standard for making web content accessible. We will highlight important WCAG Criteria using real world examples and best practices in accessibility from the mindset of GIS professionals.

Participants of this webinar will be able to:

- Utilize WCAG and other references as a guide to better understand web accessibility with ArcGIS;
- Apply best practices to produce accessible web content;
- Evaluate web apps for conformance with WCAG and identify solutions for common accessibility issues.
