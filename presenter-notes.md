## Why is accessibility important?

### Good accessibility is good user experience

Implementing accessibility can deepen our understanding of design. Considering things like tab order can take us beyond a vision of design as the look and feel and into the realm of user experience and usability. Accessibility is just another aspect of considering how to best build our sites to meet diverse human needs. The move we consider accessibility, the more profoundly we will understand user experience and anticipate user behaviorâ€”making us better designers.
